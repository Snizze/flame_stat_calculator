This calculator requires the user to know their stat equivalents.

In specific a player must know how much:
* X Main Stat =  1 All Stat
* X Main Stat = 1% All Stat
* X Main Stat = 1 Attack
* X Secondary Stat = 1 Main Stat

In addition to knowing your stat equivalents a player must also have the flame they wish to calculate on hand.


From the flame, the amount of main stat, secondary stat, and if applicable tertiary stat must be noted.

In addition to the stat, the amount of all stat% and attack must be noted as well.
